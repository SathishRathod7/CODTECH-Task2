Overview of the Project

Project:  PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH LINEAR REGRESSION   

Objective:      
The goal of this project is to implement a simple linear regression model to predict a continuous target variable using a given dataset. The project involves training the model on a subset of the data, evaluating its performance, and using the trained model to make predictions. The effectiveness of the model will be assessed using relevant performance metrics, and visualizations will be used to illustrate the model's accuracy.

Key Activities:         
  1.Dataset Selection: Choose a dataset relevant to the problem domain or area of interest.    
  2. Data Cleaning: Handle missing values through imputation or removal,Correct data types if necessary,Remove duplicates and irrelevant data     
  3. Data Transformation: Feature scaling and normalization,Encode categorical variables if necessary,Create new features from existing ones if applicable    
  4. Data Visualization: Visualize findings with histograms, scatter plots, pair plots, and heatmaps using matplotlib and seaborn. 

  Technologies Used:         
 1.Python: Programming Language     
 2.pandas: for data manipulation and analysis.     
 3. numpy: for numerical operations and array handling.     
 4. matplotlib: for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.    
 5. seaborn: for statistical data visualization.
